# Ruby Administration frameworks demo

Created to see difference between main administration gems in one place.

Used following administration gems:

- [activeadmin]([https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/))
  All of the ActiveAdmin main files could be found at `app/active_admin`.


- [rails_admin]([https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin))

- [administrate]([https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate))
  All of the ActiveAdmin main files could be found at `app/controllers/admin` and `app/dashboards`.
